## Please Note

Both Level 1 and Level 2 functionality requirements have been completed for this challenge and links to both 
are available here:

Level 1: [Level 1: Automatic Table and Date search](UFO-Level-1/index.html)
Level 2: [Level 2: Multiple Search Categories](UFO-Level-2/index.html)

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* The StarterCode/index.html file provided was used to build the initial web page.

* Upon page load, the full data set is loaded and displayed on the page.

* Data for each column listed here and available in the dataset appears on the page `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Filter and Form Submit event listeners have been implemented in the app.ja to listen and respond by searching `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.  The table displays the rendered data accurately, after clearing any previously visible data.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Multiple input tags were added to the index.html, and the app was modified so that the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings for any combination of the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

* If the user clears all of the filter criteria, then the full data set is displayed, as on original load of the page.
