## Please Note

Both Level 1 and Level 2 functionality requirements have been completed for this challenge and links to both 
folders are available here:

Level 1: [Level 1: Automatic Table and Date search](UFO-Level-1)

Level 2: [Level 2: Multiple Search Categories](UFO-Level-2)

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* The StarterCode/index.html file provided was used to build the initial web page.

* Upon page load, the full data set is loaded and displayed on the page.

* The date filter field has been implemented as a select option drop down list - to aid the user in easy selection criteria.

* Data for each column listed here and available in the dataset appears on the page: 
(`date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`)

* Filter and Form Submit event listeners have been implemented in the app.js to listen and respond by searching the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.  The table displays the rendered data accurately, after clearing any previously visible data.

* Running multiple queries subsequently works as expected.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Multiple additional input tags were added to the index.html, and the app.js was modified so that the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings for any combination of the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

* All filter fields have been implemented as select option drop down lists - to aid the user in easy selection criteria.

* If the user clears all of the filter criteria, then the full data set is displayed, as on original load of the page.

* Running multiple queries subsequently works as expected.

* Clearing all filter criteria and running the filter button displays the full data set (no filters), as it should.
